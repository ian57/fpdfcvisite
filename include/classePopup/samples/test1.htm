He brought new excitement and power to the Presidency, as he vigorously led Congress and the American public toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy.     <br><br>  He took the view that the President as a \"steward of the people\" should take whatever action necessary for the public good unless expressly forbidden by law or the Constitution.\" I did not usurp power,\" he wrote, \"but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power.\"   <br><br>  Roosevelt\'s youth differed sharply from that of the log cabin Presidents. He was born in New York City in 1858 into a wealthy family, but he too struggled--against ill health--and in his triumph became an advocate of the strenuous life. ',
