He brought new excitement and power to the Presidency, as he vigorously led Congress and the American public toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy.     <br><br>  He took the view that the President as a \"steward of the people\" should take whatever action necessary for the public good unless expressly forbidden by law or the Constitution.\" I did not usurp power,\" he wrote, \"but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power.\"   <br><br>  Roosevelt\'s youth differed sharply from that of the log cabin Presidents. He was born in New York City in 1858 into a wealthy family, but he too struggled--against ill health--and in his triumph became an advocate of the strenuous life. ',

The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine. <br><br>For centuries Paris has been one of the world\'s most important and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study, for culture, and for entertainment: its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation.',
